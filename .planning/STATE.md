## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 10 phases derived from 36 v1 requirements at fine granularity
- Architecture: Two-service split (Next.js on Vercel + FastAPI on Railway) with Supabase as communication bus
- Auth: Use getUser() not getSession() for server-side checks (security pitfall from research)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Phase 4 ingestion needs real survey data samples to validate parsing approach
- Research flag: Phase 5 validation engine architecture is critical -- consider Great Expectations/Pandera patterns
- WeasyPrint system dependencies need verification on Railway Docker during Phase 9
