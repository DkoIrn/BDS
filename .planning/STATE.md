# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Engineers can upload survey data and receive automated QC reports with every flagged issue explained -- replacing hours of manual checking with minutes of automated validation.
**Current focus:** Phase 3: File Upload & Storage

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 10 (File Upload & Storage)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-03-11 -- Plan 03-01 complete

Progress: [███████░░░] 71%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 6min
- Total execution time: 0.6 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-auth | 2/3 | 18min | 9min |
| 02-project-structure | 2/2 | 8min | 4min |
| 03-file-upload-storage | 1/2 | 4min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (4min), 02-01 (5min), 02-02 (3min), 03-01 (4min)
- Trend: Stable ~4min/plan

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 10 phases derived from 36 v1 requirements at fine granularity
- Architecture: Two-service split (Next.js on Vercel + FastAPI on Railway) with Supabase as communication bus
- Auth: Use getUser() not getSession() for server-side checks (security pitfall from research)
- Stack: Accepted Next.js 16.1.6 from create-next-app@latest instead of pinning to 15.x
- Theme: Hex color values in CSS vars (not oklch) for brand color clarity
- Forms: useActionState (React 19) for server action integration with loading/error states
- Components: shadcn/ui v4 Button does not support asChild -- use styled Link elements instead
- DialogTrigger: base-ui render prop requires ReactElement, not ReactNode -- pass element directly
- Tables: Client-side sorting for small datasets (<100 rows) with useState for column/direction
- Supabase: Relational queries via select('*, jobs(count)') for aggregated counts
- Select: base-ui Select onValueChange returns string|null -- use hidden input for form submission
- Detail pages: Server component with params Promise, auth check, ownership filter, notFound() for missing
- Storage: User UUID as folder prefix for RLS scoping on storage.objects
- File actions: createFileRecord is plain async (not form action), called after client upload succeeds
- Download URLs: Signed URLs with 5-minute (300s) expiry

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Phase 4 ingestion needs real survey data samples to validate parsing approach
- Research flag: Phase 5 validation engine architecture is critical -- consider Great Expectations/Pandera patterns
- WeasyPrint system dependencies need verification on Railway Docker during Phase 9
