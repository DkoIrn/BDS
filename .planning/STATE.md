# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Engineers can upload survey data and receive automated QC reports with every flagged issue explained -- replacing hours of manual checking with minutes of automated validation.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation & Auth

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation & Auth)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-10 -- Plan 01-01 complete

Progress: [▓░░░░░░░░░] 3%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 14min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-auth | 1/3 | 14min | 14min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (14min)
- Trend: Starting

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 10 phases derived from 36 v1 requirements at fine granularity
- Architecture: Two-service split (Next.js on Vercel + FastAPI on Railway) with Supabase as communication bus
- Auth: Use getUser() not getSession() for server-side checks (security pitfall from research)
- Stack: Accepted Next.js 16.1.6 from create-next-app@latest instead of pinning to 15.x
- Theme: Hex color values in CSS vars (not oklch) for brand color clarity

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Phase 4 ingestion needs real survey data samples to validate parsing approach
- Research flag: Phase 5 validation engine architecture is critical -- consider Great Expectations/Pandera patterns
- WeasyPrint system dependencies need verification on Railway Docker during Phase 9
