# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Engineers can upload survey data and receive automated QC reports with every flagged issue explained -- replacing hours of manual checking with minutes of automated validation.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Project Structure

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Project Structure) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-10 -- Plan 02-02 complete

Progress: [▓▓░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 7min
- Total execution time: 0.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-auth | 2/3 | 18min | 9min |
| 02-project-structure | 2/2 | 8min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (14min), 01-02 (4min), 02-01 (5min), 02-02 (3min)
- Trend: Accelerating

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 10 phases derived from 36 v1 requirements at fine granularity
- Architecture: Two-service split (Next.js on Vercel + FastAPI on Railway) with Supabase as communication bus
- Auth: Use getUser() not getSession() for server-side checks (security pitfall from research)
- Stack: Accepted Next.js 16.1.6 from create-next-app@latest instead of pinning to 15.x
- Theme: Hex color values in CSS vars (not oklch) for brand color clarity
- Forms: useActionState (React 19) for server action integration with loading/error states
- Components: shadcn/ui v4 Button does not support asChild -- use styled Link elements instead
- DialogTrigger: base-ui render prop requires ReactElement, not ReactNode -- pass element directly
- Tables: Client-side sorting for small datasets (<100 rows) with useState for column/direction
- Supabase: Relational queries via select('*, jobs(count)') for aggregated counts
- Select: base-ui Select onValueChange returns string|null -- use hidden input for form submission
- Detail pages: Server component with params Promise, auth check, ownership filter, notFound() for missing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Phase 4 ingestion needs real survey data samples to validate parsing approach
- Research flag: Phase 5 validation engine architecture is critical -- consider Great Expectations/Pandera patterns
- WeasyPrint system dependencies need verification on Railway Docker during Phase 9
